ContentGuard
============

A decentralized content moderation protocol for social platforms built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity. This system enables **community-driven content moderation** by leveraging **staking**, **voting**, and **reputation** mechanisms, incentivizing honest participation and penalizing malicious behavior.

* * * * *

üöÄ Overview
-----------

The **ContentGuard** contract provides a foundational layer for decentralized social platforms to manage content flags and removals without relying on a central authority. It shifts the power of moderation to a staked community of users, ensuring transparency, fairness, and censorship resistance.

### Key Features

-   **Content Creation:** Users can post content, represented by a unique hash.

-   **Decentralized Reporting:** Any user can report content by staking a minimum amount of STX, flagging the post for review.

-   **Moderator Role:** Users who maintain a high reputation score can become **Moderators**, giving them the right to vote on flagged content.

-   **Staked Voting:** Moderators vote 'For' or 'Against' a report by staking their own tokens, aligning their financial incentive with the protocol's integrity.

-   **Automated Resolution:** Reports are resolved after a fixed voting period, and the content's final status is determined by a simple majority vote.

-   **Reputation System:** Users and Moderators are rewarded or penalized based on the outcome of the reports they file or vote on, ensuring long-term honest participation.

-   **Financial Incentives:** Stakes are distributed to reward honest reporters and voters, or forfeited to penalize dishonest behavior.

‚öôÔ∏è Contract Details
-------------------

The contract is written in **Clarity**, the smart contract language for the Stacks blockchain.

### Constants

| **Constant** | **Value** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CONTRACT_OWNER` | `tx-sender` | The principal who deployed the contract (used for owner-only actions, though not explicitly used in public functions here). |
| `MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT` | `u1000000` (1 STX) | The minimum amount of STX required to file a report or vote. |
| `VOTING_PERIOD` | `u144` | The number of blocks for which a report remains open for voting (approx. 24 hours). |
| `MODERATOR_THRESHOLD` | `u5000000` (5 STX) | The minimum reputation score required for a user to become a Moderator. |
| `REPUTATION_PENALTY` | `-10` | Signed integer reduction in reputation for dishonesty (false reports, wrong votes, etc.). |
| `REPUTATION_REWARD` | `5` | Signed integer increase in reputation for honest participation (successful reports, correct votes, etc.). |

### Error Codes

| **Error Code** | **Value** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ERR_NOT_AUTHORIZED` | `u100` | Transaction sender lacks required authority (e.g., trying to become moderator without sufficient reputation). |
| `ERR_POST_NOT_FOUND` | `u101` | The specified post ID does not exist. |
| `ERR_ALREADY_REPORTED` | `u102` | An attempt was made to create a report that already exists. |
| `ERR_INSUFFICIENT_STAKE` | `u103` | The provided stake amount is less than `MIN_STAKE_AMOUNT`. |
| `ERR_VOTING_PERIOD_ENDED` | `u104` | Attempting to vote on a report after the voting period has ended or if the report is already resolved. |
| `ERR_ALREADY_VOTED` | `u105` | A user is attempting to vote on the same report twice. |
| `ERR_INVALID_VOTE` | `u106` | A resolution attempt failed because no votes were cast (`total-votes == u0`). |
| `ERR_NOT_MODERATOR` | `u107` | Transaction sender attempted a Moderator-only action without having the role. |

### Data Maps and Variables

| **Data Structure** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `posts` | Map | Stores content details: `author`, `content-hash`, `timestamp`, `status` (`"active"`, `"flagged"`, `"removed"`), and `reports-count`. |
| `reports` | Map | Stores report details: `post-id`, `reporter`, `reason`, `stake-amount`, `timestamp`, vote counts (`votes-for`, `votes-against`), and `resolved` status. |
| `user-reputation` | Map | Tracks user-specific data: `reputation` score (defaulting to u100) and `is-moderator` boolean flag. |
| `report-votes` | Map | Records individual moderator votes: `vote` (`bool`) and `stake` amount. |
| `next-post-id` | Data Var | Auto-incrementing counter for new posts. |
| `next-report-id` | Data Var | Auto-incrementing counter for new reports. |
| `total-staked` | Data Var | Tracks the total STX currently staked within the contract. |

üîí Private Functions (Internal Logic)
-------------------------------------

These functions encapsulate core logic for managing the reputation system and checking user roles, ensuring clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

### `(is-moderator (user principal))`

Checks if a given principal holds the Moderator role by querying the `user-reputation` map.

-   **Input:** `user` (principal)

-   **Output:** `(bool)` - `true` if the user is a moderator, `false` otherwise.

### `(get-user-reputation (user principal))`

Retrieves the current reputation score for a given principal. Defaults to **u100** if no entry is found for the user, establishing a base reputation for new users.

-   **Input:** `user` (principal)

-   **Output:** `(uint)` - The user's reputation score.

### `(update-reputation (user principal) (change int))`

The core function for modifying a user's reputation score. It handles both positive (rewards) and negative (penalties) changes. It also ensures the score does not fall below zero.

-   **Inputs:**

    -   `user` (principal): The user whose reputation is being updated.

    -   `change` (int): The amount of change. Positive for rewards, negative for penalties.

-   **Output:** `(response bool unit)` - Returns `(ok true)` upon successful update.

üõ†Ô∏è Public Functions (Entrypoints)
----------------------------------

### `(create-post (content-hash (string-ascii 64)))`

Creates a new content entry, marking the user as the `author` and setting the initial `status` to `"active"`.

### `(report-content (post-id uint) (reason (string-ascii 100)) (stake-amount uint))`

Transfers `stake-amount` STX from `tx-sender` to the contract, creates a new report, and sets the post's status to `"flagged"`. Requires a minimum stake.

### `(become-moderator)`

Allows `tx-sender` to opt-in to the Moderator role if their current reputation (retrieved via `get-user-reputation`) is greater than or equal to `MODERATOR_THRESHOLD`.

### `(vote-on-report (report-id uint) (vote bool) (stake-amount uint))`

Transfers `stake-amount` STX from the moderator to the contract, records their vote (`true` for uphold/remove, `false` for reject/keep), and updates the report's aggregate vote counts. Requires the sender to be an active moderator and the voting period to be active.

### `(resolve-report-and-distribute-rewards (report-id uint))`

Executed after the `VOTING_PERIOD` ends. This function determines the final outcome based on a majority vote, resolves the post status, and adjusts reputation and stakes:

-   **Report Upheld:** Post removed. Post Author penalized. Reporter rewarded and stake returned **plus bonus**.

-   **Report Rejected:** Post status returns to "active". Reporter penalized. Post Author rewarded. Reporter's stake **forfeited** to the Post Author.

* * * * *

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitation (Voter Rewards)
-----------------------------------

The current implementation of `resolve-report-and-distribute-rewards` correctly handles the **Reporter's stake** and the **Reputation updates** for the Reporter and Post Author. However, it only updates the `total-staked` variable by subtracting the reporter's stake and **does not iterate through the `report-votes` map** to refund or reward the individual Moderators who voted. In a fully productionized version, a loop or a separate mechanism would be required to distribute the accumulated stakes proportionally to the moderators who voted correctly (i.e., aligning with the majority outcome).
